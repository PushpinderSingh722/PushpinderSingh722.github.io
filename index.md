Introduction to Moodle:
Moodle is the acronym for Modular Object- Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment it's an online Learning Management System (LMS). It is free of cost platform for online learning courses. It provides flexible learning as content provision can be made online and can be accessed on smartphones anytime.

Course creation:
In Week 1, I have learnt how to create courses and various enrolment methods, how self-enrolment can be made available and how to add syllabus and content to our courses. In addition to these, I have learnt about the various tools in activity (such as chats, forums, quizzes, assignments etc.) and resources for tasks such as adding quizzes and tests, customizing topic names, turn editing on etc. 
Web site creation:
For creating website, I have used github.com and learnt how to create repositories and how to add pages in repositories. For uploading course journals, it is mandatory to create website and github provides free licenses for the websites.
